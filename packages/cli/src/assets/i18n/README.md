# Shagatam Prithivi!

This directory contains translations for your project.

Read [the intl docs](https://intljs.com/docs) for more information.

If you'd like to update your JSON schema, update the `Schema` interface in your `intl.config.ts`.
This will allow you to easily add new translations and ensure that existing tranlastions are covering your project.

To scaffold out new translations, you can run (where 'locale' is a single code or comma separated list of codes)
```
intl add <locale>
```
